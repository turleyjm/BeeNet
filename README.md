# BeeNet: Reconstructing Flower Shapes from Electric Fields using Deep Learning

A deep learning framework for solving the inverse electrostatic imaging problem, enabling flower shape reconstruction directly from measured electric fields.

## Abstract

Pollinating insects can obtain information from electric fields arising from flowers. The density and usefulness of electric information remain unknown. Here, we show that electric information can be used to reconstruct geometrical features of the field source. We develop an algorithm that infers the shapes of polarisable flowers from the electric field generated in response to a nearby charged arthropod. We computed the electric fields arising from arthropod–flower interactions for varying petal geometries, and used these data to train a deep learning U-Net model to recreate the floral shapes. The model accurately reconstructed diverse shapes, including more complex flower morphologies not included in training. Reconstruction performance peaked at an optimal arthropod–flower distance, indicating distance-dependent encoding of shape information. These findings indicate that electroreception can impart rich spatial detail, offering insights into the electric ecology of arthropods. Together, this work introduces a deep learning framework for solving the inverse electrostatic imaging problem, enabling object shape reconstruction directly from measured electric fields.

## Workflow

The complete workflow consists of three main stages:

### 1. Dataset Preparation

Prepare the electric field images and corresponding flower mask data:

```bash
python makeDataSet.py
```

This script organizes images into training, validation, and testing splits in the `dat/` directory.

### 2. Model Training

Train the U-Net model to learn the mapping from electric field patterns to flower shapes:

- Open `trainingUNetPetal.ipynb` in Jupyter
- Run all cells to train the model
- The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory

The U-Net architecture learns to reconstruct flower geometries from electric field measurements generated by arthropod-flower interactions.

### 3. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model on test data:

- Open `evaluateUNetPetal.ipynb` in Jupyter
- Run all cells to generate predictions on the test set
- Predictions are saved to the `outputs/` directory

### 4. Analysis

Analyze the reconstructed petal masks:

```bash
python analysePetals.py
python assessPetals.py
```

These scripts quantify reconstruction accuracy and assess the quality of predicted flower shapes across different geometries and arthropod-flower distances.

## Data

The dataset consists of:
- **Input**: Electric field images generated from simulated arthropod-flower interactions
- **Output**: Binary masks representing flower petal geometries

Electric fields are computed for varying petal geometries and arthropod distances to capture distance-dependent shape encoding.

The data can be found at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/16879470).
